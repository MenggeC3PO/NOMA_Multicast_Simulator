# NOMA Multicast Performance Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB scripts for simulating the performance of a Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) multicast communication system. The project includes scripts for evaluating average multicast rates and outage probabilities for different user classes and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).

## Contents
- `NomaHybridMultiServiceMulticast.m` - Main simulation script for evaluating the NOMA system's multicast performance.
- `NomaMultiRateMulticast.m` 
- `NomaMultiServiceMulticast.m` - Multicast simulation with outage probability

## Features
- Monte Carlo simulation for assessing NOMA multicast rates.
- Analysis of outage probabilities under various SNR conditions.
- Plot generation for visualizing performance metrics.
